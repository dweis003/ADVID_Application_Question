2. Select the appropriate database system, programming/scripting languages, 
and data report formats to implement this system. Provide a brief explanation 
for each choice and save it in a document format of your choice.

-For my programming language I chose Python as I believed it would be the easiest
langauage to set up and run a database in without having to install a variety 
of libraries and other applications. For my database I chose to use SQLite as 
it is a built in library of Python. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Create 3 to 10 records of test data to provide a good representation of the ID 
and timestamp ranges. Your data does not need to provide full test coverage but 
they should include the following: 
(a) 3 records with an ID that start with the character ‘A’ and a timestamp on 
November 6, 2018. 

(b) At least 2 records have different dates 
(c) At least one address is in Norco, CA
Save the test records in a text file using a format of your choice. 

-I chose to store my records in CSV files as they are easy to use in 
a variety of programs and applications and the files themselves can be easily 
viewed with only a text editor. 

Also, provide a brief description of the coverage provided by each test record.
-MY RECORDS ARE:
ABC123,John Cena,9098845789,"411 info lane Riverside CA, 92501, USA",2018-11-06 22:11:24
ABB124,Mike Trout,9513214567,"4978 Main Sreet Norco CA, 82401, USA",2018-11-06 19:07:50
ABD125,Lady Gaga,7418906600,"711 Sing Ave Malibu CA, 90210, USA",2018-04-09 19:17:43
CBA321,Don Weiss,9092373999,"7 Candy Lane San Bernardino CA, 92404, USA",2018-11-05 01:11:24
BBB845,George Washington,1011841886,"1786 Const Road Colton CA, 93501, USA",2018-11-06 22:10:24

For my test I created 5 records. Records 1, 2 and 3 are my records that have IDs
that start with 'A'. They also have different phone numbers, addresses and 
timestamp. However as required two of them are on Novemeber 11, 2018. My final 
two records ID both don't start with 'A' and like the prior 3 have different
names, phone numbers and addresses however record 5 does have Novemeber 6, 2018
as its timestamp. I feel my 5 records provide for adequate testing and for example
I also made use of a city whose name consists of more than one word "San Bernardino"
and if you look at my CITY table I chose cities with similar names as to try to confuse
my solution to question 5 I.E. in my records there is the city Norco and in
my CITY table the cities Norco and Norton exist.

4A. Use a programming language you selected for Question 2, write a function or 
class to generate a two-column table that shows the record count of the IDs that
start with the character ‘A’ in each of the 24 hours in an arbitrary day. This 
table will have 24 rows of data. The first column of the table is the hour number 
in a 24-hour clock and the second column of the table is the number of records 
with a timestamp within the corresponding hour.

SQL SOLUTION:

SELECT strftime('%H',Time_Stamp) as "Hour",  count(strftime('H',Time_Stamp)) 
FROM RECORDS 
Where ID LIKE 'A%'
Group By Hour
ORDER BY Hour ASC;

NOTE: My solution assumes that given enough records that all 24 hours of the 
day will be represented. However, if the records are small all 24 might not be.

4B.Using this function or class to generate a table for November 6, 2018 using 
the data you selected for Question 3. Select an output format that is appropriate 
for on-screen display.

SQL SOLUTION:

SELECT * FROM RECORDS
WHERE strftime('%Y %m %d',Time_Stamp) = '2018 11 06';

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Use a programming language you selected for Question 2, write a function to 
identify the city within an address. Assume that all addresses have a valid city 
name and your system has unlimited access to a database with all the valid city 
names. Create a list of unique cities from the data you selected for Question 3. 
Arrange the cities in alphabetical order.

SQL SOLUTION:

Select C.City_Name FROM CITIES C
WHERE  EXISTS
(SELECT * FROM RECORDS WHERE Address LIKE '%' || C.City_Name || '%')
GROUP BY C.City_Name ORDER By C.City_Name ASC;
